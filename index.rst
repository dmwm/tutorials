DMWM Tutorials
==============

The aims of these tutorials are:

* to ensure a base line understanding across all the tools and technologies
  in use in DMWM
* to provide a library of information useful to developers new to a subject
* to improve dissemination of information on new tools and technologies

Some tutorials may appear basic, but we hope that all attendees -- including
the tutor! -- will learn something from each tutorial. The intention is for
the tutorials to occur monthly, and to last for ~3 hours. If you would like
to propose or request a tutorial send a mail to ``hn-cms-compTechProject``.
The tutorials are geared towards issues that DMWM developers may face, but
they're not restricted to that audience, and we actively encourage operations
and other interested parties to attend.
