# DMWM Developer Tutorials
(see also: https://svnweb.cern.ch/trac/CMSDMWM/wiki/DMWMDeveloperTutorials)

The aims of the tutorials are:

 * to ensure a base line understanding across all the tools and technologies in use in DMWM
 * to provide a library of information useful to developers new to a subject
 * to improve dissemination of information on new tools/technologies

Some tutorials may appear basic, but we hope that all attendees (including the tutor!) will learn something from each tutorial. The intention is for the tutorials to occur monthly, and to last for ~3 hours. If you would like to propose or request a tutorial send a mail to < hn-cms-compTechProject>. The tutorials are geared towards issues that DMWM developers may face, but they're not restricted to that audience, and we actively encourage operations and other interested parties to attend.
